### Observability
#### The Three pillars of observability

Tracing, Logging, Metrics.

#### Blackbox vs. Whitebox monitoring
Blackbox means that we look at what we put in and what we get out but not what's in the "box". We are just happy with having the application up and running not paying attention to what exactly it's doing.

Whitebox, means that we are looking at whats happening inside the "box" and have an understanding of whats happenign inside. Instead now we know whats happening inside, and we can with the right knowledge of the application see whats happening inside.

#### Alerting

An alert means that we are sending out a message with some level of urgency related to it, it could require immediete attention or just that it needs to be tended to at all. These alerts could be sent an email, or other means of messaging depending on the level of urgency involved.

#### Monitoring Signals

Latency, the time it takes per service request. We also need to be aware of what Error latency would be as an error might be served very fast as well so we shouuld be aware and not filter everything out.

Traffic, what kind of demand is there on the service, are we getting 1 000 requests per second, 10 000 requests, or what ever that number might be. It depends on the type of service what we exactly define as traffic for it. It could be as simple as HTTP requests or concurrent users. 

Errors, failed HTTP requests, failed healthchecks, or other kind of logic based failures.

Saturation, what kind of load and utilization do we have on the service and will it impact performance? It can also help us with making a predictions of saturation, e.g., our storage will be at maximum capacity in 3 hours.
