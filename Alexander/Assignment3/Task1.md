### Observability
#### The Three pillars of observability

Tracing, Logging, Metrics.

#### Blackbox vs. Whitebox monitoring
Blackbox means that we look at what we put in and what we get out but not what's in the "box". We are just happy with having the application up and running not paying attention to what exactly it's doing.

Whitebox, means that we are looking at whats happening inside the "box" and have an understanding of whats happenign inside. Instead now we know whats happening inside, and we can with the right knowledge of the application see whats happening inside.

#### Alerting

An alert means that we are sending out a message with some level of urgency related to it, it could require immediete attention or just that it needs to be tended to at all. These alerts could be sent an email, or other means of messaging depending on the level of urgency involved.
